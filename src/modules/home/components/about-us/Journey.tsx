                      1st place in the APF Tokyo Runway Model competition. These

                      Hey there, I'm Lyn! 34 years young and a proud island girl
                      from the one and only Penang!
                    </p>

                    <p className="italic">
                      By day, I'm a gazetting Family Medicine Specialist. By
                      heart, I'm the founder of SelflessTogether, an
                      organisation that provides free education to refugee and
                      stateless children right here in Penang. I've always
                      believed in standing up for the voiceless, lifting up the
                      helpless, and making sure no one gets left behind.

                      When I'm not in clinic or running community projects,
                      you'll probably catch me sweating it out on a spin bike,
                      running, or throwing weights around. That's my kind of
                      therapy!

                        Oh, yes I'm obsessed with TRES' outfits. Their outfits
                        don't just look good, they feel incredible. Perfect for
                        my chaotic, on-the-go, sweat-soaked lifestyle.

                        There's this quote from Michelle Obama that has stuck
                        with me: "There's no limit to what we as women can
                        accomplish". It reminds me that women are powerful,
                        resilient, and so beautifully capable of creating
                        change, not just for ourselves, but for the people
                        around us too.
